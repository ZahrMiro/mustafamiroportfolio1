        <h1>Insight</h1>
          <article>
            <p class="casestudy-p">Working with Al-Jaish has added tons of value and lessons to my coaching journey , as a professionally-first-timer strength&conditioning coach , the main hardship at that time was trying to find a suitable system to control an environment of different physical states and different player mentalities throughout a 7-month season.
              Although I handled the business with no assistant coach that season , team performance has elevated noticably with the work of medical and technical team , the data and feedback written and analyzed by coaches , as well as the effort of all responsible people to finally reach the "Syrian Cup" stage crowned winners with massive consecutive performances.
              </ul>

            <article>
              <h2 class="casestudy-h2">Player-Centric Approach</h2>
              <p class="casestudy-p"> Given the diverse physical states and mentalities of the players, adaptability was key.I was able to adjust training plans and strategies based on individual needs, injuries, and performance goals , ensuring that each player received optimal support throughout the season.</p>

              <h2 class="casestudy-h2">Effective Communication</h2>
              <p class="casestudy-p">Clear and open communication are essential factors in my work for building rapport with players and fostering a positive team environment. I established trust and understanding with each player enabling effective collaboration and ensuring that training objectives were aligned with individual aspirations. Regular feedback sessions and constructive dialogue helped addressing concerns and maintain motivation among my players</p>

              <p class="casestudy-p">The next steps were mock-up and high fidelity prototype. The high fidelity prototype was then tested and adjusted accordingly.</p>

              <h2 class="casestudy-h2">Strategic Planning and Organization</h2>
              <p class="casestudy-p"> I developed a comprehensive training system that accounts for the unique demands of a 7-month season requires meticulous planning and organization. This included structuring training sessions, managing recovery periods, and coordinating with other staff members to optimize player performance</p>
              <p class="casestudy-p">Me establishing clear objectives and timelines, that allowed for effective monitoring of progress and adjustment of strategies as necessary.</p>

Context and time-frame were studied at that period , athletes were assessed , relevantly , as national team participations come almost all the time in a 
short and limited period of time</p>
              <p class="casestudy-p">Athletes were assessed and evaluated balancing between needed data , and limited time that we have.</p>
